## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-10

### Security

- **User data excluded from version control** — `data/tasks.json` and `data/crons.json` added to `.gitignore` to prevent personal task data from being committed to the public repo
- **Demo data templates** — Renamed to `demo-tasks.json` and `demo-crons.json` as safe templates for new installations
- **Branch protection enabled** — Direct pushes to `main` blocked; PRs with review required

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-07

### Security

- **Input sanitization in `mc-update.sh`** — Replaced heredoc-based Python interpolation with environment variable passing to prevent shell injection
- **`sanitize_input()` function** — Blocks backticks and `$` characters in all script arguments
- **Security documentation** — Added Security section to SKILL.md and README.md documenting the trust model, mitigations, and recommendations

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Version Update Banner** — Dashboard now shows a notification banner when a new version is available
  - Checks `data/version.json` every 5 minutes
